# Tabs-Prank

## April  1st,  2023

I had just thought of the idea of pranking my classmates and was looking at different ways.

### June  2023

I made the final prototype, and for my graduation year, I comitted the prank.

#### My Tests

In my tests, this worked  100% of the time and was pretty easy to execute. In total I got over 8000 victims pranked. I used to have a logging system that would grab the browser and IP address of every user who opened the site, but I will not reveal that as:
- It's fun to do it yourself.
- I lost the code LOL
- The internet is filled with people with bad intentions

#### What is this???

Well, you see, this simple website once opened asks the user a simple yes or no question (it still does it if the user selects no or yes), which activates a script. This script causes chaos by opening billions of tabs, going to an easy redirect: [https://classroom.google.com/](https://classroom.google.com/). It's simple and effective, especially on low-end hardware.

On Chromebooks, it either crashes and restarts or becomes too laggy and requires a restart.

Have Fun!!!
